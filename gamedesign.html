        <h2>Central Processing</h2>
        <p>
            Central Processing is a cooperative card-based puzzle game for two players about learning 
            elements of binary logic â€” the building blocks of computer code. We wanted to make the game
            as freely accessible as possible: it can be played with nothing more than the rules, a pencil 
            and paper, and a standard deck of playing cards. 
            Or, you can print and play our custom deck.

            See the gameplay instructions <a href="https://camillazamboni.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/egl/fall-2022/central-processing/">here</a>, 
            or the version with an online randomizer on my groupmate's website <a href="https://imyxh.net/central_processing/">here</a>.

            Created by Luca Guerrera, Ivy Huang, and Ford McDill. I collaborated with Ivy and Ford in designing 
            the game and iterative playtesting of the rules. I also designed the custom deck from scratch.
